### Matrix Helper
This program is an aid in matrix computation. It is meant to help keep track of calculations while allowing dynamic modification of a matrix. It excels not at automated calculation, but user-driven computation. Using verbose mode, the Matrix Helper program will "show work" by outputting text to terminal.

Ouptut to a TeX file will be implemented once reliable functionality is established.

Let's put this in the public domain, use it however you like!
